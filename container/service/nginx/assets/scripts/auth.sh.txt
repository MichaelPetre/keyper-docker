# This scripts does the work of authorized_keys file by calling REST API    #
# and gets Public for the user attempting to login using SSH.               #
#                                                                           #
# The script accepts two parameters:                                        #
# 1. USER: linux username of the user trying to login is a mandetory        #
#           parameter. It is set using %u on AuthorizedKeysCommand          #
# 2. Ffingerprint: SSH Key finger print is an optional parameter. It is set #
#                  usign %f on AuthorizedKeysCommand                        #                          
# - Deploy this script under /etc/ssh (or corresponding location in your    #
#   distro).                                                                #
# - Rename it as auth.sh, and make sure it is owned by root and is          #
#   executable.                                                             #
#   # chown root:root auth.sh                                               #
#   # chmod +x auth.sh                                                      #
# - Adjust KEYPER_HOST per the hostname and port.                           #
# - Adjust HTTP protocol to http or https per your configuration of keyper. #
# - Add following lines to sshd_config file (%f is optional)                #
#    AuthorizedKeysCommand /bin/sh /etc/ssh/auth.sh %u %f                   #
#    AuthorizedKeysCommandUser root                                         #
# - Make sure that HOST is set to the hostname defined in keyper console.   #
# - Restart sshdÂ                                                            #
# - Test script by invoking it on CLI                                       #
#   # /etc/ssh/auth.sh <username>                                           #
# - Above must return a SSH public key of the user                          #
#                                                                           #
